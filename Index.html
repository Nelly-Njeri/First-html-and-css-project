      <h2>Software Engineer in the Making</h2>
      <p>Being a software engineer in the making is not all starry-eyed wonder and whispered secrets. It's late nights fueled by lukewarm coffee. It's wrestling with compiler errors, debugging your code, and wondering if that semicolon at the end of line 42 holds the key to universal consciousness (it probably doesn't). And being a woman in this field? That's a whole other level of awesome. It's like scaling Mount Everest in pink glitter heels. It's proving doubters wrong with every keystroke, shattering glass ceilings with every successful build. It's knowing that every line of code I write paves the way for the next generation of girls who dream of conquering the digital frontier.</p>

      <p>Resilient. It's not about never falling, but about rising stronger, each scar a testament to battles won.</p>
      <p>Kind. A gentle whisper in a world of noise, a hand outstretched in empathy. Grace paints the world with compassion, her actions speaking louder than words.</p>
      <p>Caring. She is understanding, woven with patience and a deep regard for all. Grace nurtures and nurtures, a beacon of warmth in the coldest of nights.</p>
